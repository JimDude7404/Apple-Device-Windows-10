# Apple Devices for Windows-10
The Windows 11 Apple Devices preview app on Windows 10.

# Issues
The app just straight up does not work. This is NOT a Windows 10 issue. The app itself is just broken. All of the reviews also say so.

# So what now?
I will not be plushing a full release until the app is fully working. It is not worth my time in its current state. Thank you for the support :)

# At least the app opens!

Once Apple fixes this app I will update this GitHub with the fully working version. :)
